  <h2 id="cats">Warrior Cats, by Erin Hunter</h2>
  <p>warriors is a fiction story based on wild cats who survive during hardship, battles and just territory skermishes that has caused so many unessecary deaths. warriors is also based on the author's love for cats and their purrrrr-sonalities.the author
    has also created the cats' religeon such as their fallen friends go ride the soft swaying grass of starclan, which is their version of heaven. there is another afterlife that casts in the wicked souls.as well as the warriors' religeon goes the code
    made for them laid down by their founders that came from the mountains or in the grasses and gave up their old ways to settle down and create what is known as the warrior code or the law in our world. <br> I never knew that just one person's intrests
    and imagination would be brought down and put into a book neatly.
